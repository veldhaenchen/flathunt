# Define filters to exclude flats that don't meet your critera.
# Supported filters include 'max_rooms', 'min_rooms', 'max_size', 'min_size',
#   'max_price', 'min_price', and 'excluded_titles'.
#
# 'excluded_titles' takes a list of regex patterns that match against
# the title of the flat. Any matching titles will be excluded.
# More to Python regex here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html

# Example:
# filters:
#   excluded_titles:
#     - "wg"
#     - "zwischenmiete"
#   min_price: 700
#   max_price: 1000

blacklist:

# If an expose includes an address, the bot is capable of
# displaying the distance and time to travel (duration) to
# some configured other addresses, for specific kinds of
# travel.
#  
# Available kinds of travel ('gm_id') can be found in the
# Google Maps API documentation, but basically there are:
# 	- "bicycling"
#	- "transit" (public transport)
#	- "driving"
#   - "walking"
# 
# The example configuration below includes a place for
# "John", located at the main train station of munich.
# Two kinds of travel (bicycle and transit) are requested,
# each with a different label. Furthermore a place for
# "Jane" is included, located at the given destination and
# with the same kinds of travel.
durations:
    - name: John
      destination: Hauptbahnhof, München
      modes: 
          - gm_id: transit
            title: "Öff."
          - gm_id: bicycling
            title: "Rad"
    - name: Jane
      destination: Karlsplatz, München
      modes: 
          - gm_id: transit
            title: "Öff."
          - gm_id: driving
            title: "Auto"

# If you are planning to scrape immoscout24.de, the bot will need 
# to circumvent the sites captcha protection by using a captcha 
# solving service. Register at either imagetypers or 2captcha 
# (the former is prefered), desposit some funds, uncomment the 
# corresponding lines below and replace your API key/token.
# you will also have to install a Chrome Web Driver and write below 
# the executable path, the driver_arguments can be left as is.

#       imagetypers:
#             token: alskdjaskldjfklj

# Sending messages using Telegram requires a Telegram Bot configured. 
# Telegram.org offers a good documentation about how to create a bot.
# Once you read it, will make sense. Still: bot_token should hold the
# access token of your bot and receiver_ids should list the client ids
# of receivers. Note that those receivers are required to already have
# started a conversation with your bot. 
#
# telegram:
#   bot_token: 160165XXXXXXX....
#   receiver_ids:
#       - 12345....
#       - 67890....

# Sending messages via mattermost requires a webhook url provided by a
# mattermost server. You can find a description how to set up a webhook with
# the official mattermost documentation:
# https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/webhooks-incoming.html
# mattermost:
#   webhook_url: https://mattermost.example.com/signup_user_complete/?id=abcdef12356

# If you are running the web interface, you can configure Login with Telegram support
# Follow the instructions here to register your domain with the Telegram bot:
# https://core.telegram.org/widgets/login
#
# website:
#    bot_name: bot_name_xxx
#    domain: flathunter.example.com
#    session_key: SomeSecretValue
#    listen:
