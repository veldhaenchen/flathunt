# Currently supported services: www.immobilienscout24.de,

# Define filters to exclude flats that don't meet your critera.
# Supported filters include 'max_rooms', 'min_rooms', 'max_size', 'min_size',
#   'max_price', 'min_price', and 'excluded_titles'.
#
# 'excluded_titles' takes a list of regex patterns that match against
# the title of the flat. Any matching titles will be excluded.
# More to Python regex here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html

# Example:
# filters:
#   excluded_titles:
#     - "wg"
#     - "zwischenmiete"
#   min_price: 700
#   max_price: 1000

# There are often city districts in the address which
# Google Maps does not like. Use this blacklist to remove
# districts from the search.
#
# blacklist:
#   - Innenstadt

# If an expose includes an address, the bot is capable of
# displaying the distance and time to travel (duration) to
# some configured other addresses, for specific kinds of
# travel.
#  
# Available kinds of travel ('gm_id') can be found in the
# Google Maps API documentation, but basically there are:
#	- "bicycling"
#	- "transit" (public transport)
#	- "driving"
# - "walking"
# 
# The example configuration below includes a place for
# "John", located at the main train station of munich.
# Two kinds of travel (bicycle and transit) are requested,
# each with a different label. Furthermore a place for
# "Jane" is included, located at the given destination and
# with the same kinds of travel.
# durations:
#   - name: John
#     destination: Hauptbahnhof, München
#     modes:
#       - gm_id: transit
#         title: "Öff."
#       - gm_id: bicycling
#         title: "Rad"
#   - name: Jane
#     destination: Karlsplatz, München
#     modes:
#       - gm_id: transit
#         title: "Öff."
#       - gm_id: driving
#         title: "Auto"

# Multiline message (yes, the | is supposed to be there), 
# to format the message received from the Telegram bot. 
# 
# Available placeholders:
# 	- {title}: The title of the expose
#	- {rooms}: Number of rooms
#	- {price}: Price for the flat
# 	- {durations}: Durations calculated by GMaps, see above
#	- {url}: URL to the expose
message: |
    {title}
    Zimmer: {rooms}
    Größe: {size}
    Preis: {price}
    Ort: {address}

    {url}

# Calculating durations requires access to the Google Maps API. 
# Below you can configure the URL to access the API, with placeholders.
# The URL should most probably just kept like that. 
# To use the Google Maps API, an API key is required. You can obtain one
# without costs from the Google App Console (just google for it).
# Additionally, to enable the API calls in the code, set the 'enable' key to True
#
# google_maps_api:
#   key: YOUR_API_KEY
#   url: https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json?origins={origin}&destinations={dest}&mode={mode}&sensor=true&key={key}&arrival_time={arrival}

# If you are planning to scrape immoscout24.de, the bot will need 
# to circumvent the sites captcha protection by using a captcha 
# solving service. Register at either imagetypers or 2captcha 
# (the former is prefered), desposit some funds, uncomment the 
# corresponding lines below and replace your API key/token.
# Use driver_arguments to provide options for Chrome WebDriver.

# You can select whether to be notified by telegram, apprise or a mattermost

# Sending messages using Telegram requires a Telegram Bot configured. 
# Telegram.org offers a good documentation about how to create a bot.
# Once you read it, will make sense. Still: bot_token should hold the
# access token of your bot and receiver_ids should list the client ids
# of receivers. Note that those receivers are required to already have
# started a conversation with your bot. 
#
# telegram:
#   bot_token: 160165XXXXXXX....
#   notify_with_images: true
#   receiver_ids:
#       - 12345....
#       - 67890....
telegram:

# Sending messages via mattermost requires a webhook url provided by a
# mattermost server. You can find a description how to set up a webhook with
# the official mattermost documentation:
# https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/webhooks-incoming.html
# mattermost:
#   webhook_url: https://mattermost.example.com/signup_user_complete/?id=abcdef12356

# Sending messages using Apprise requires an Apprise url.
# Apprise allows to send notifications to a wide variety of services.
# You can find a description how to set up an Apprise url with the official
# documentation: https://github.com/caronc/apprise
